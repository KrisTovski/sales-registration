# Sales Registration App

This project is based on **Servlets and JSP** (JakartaServer pages) - included in **JakartaEE**.
The reason I created this application was **to learn the foundations of web applications**.
I think the application will not be further developed. I would like to focus on the Spring framework rather than legacy code.
